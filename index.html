  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 11, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>App Name:</strong> Paperless+</p>
  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> [Your Company/Developer Name]</p>
  <p><strong>Contact Email:</strong> [your-email@example.com]</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>Paperless+ is a privacy-focused document management application that operates entirely offline. This privacy policy outlines how Paperless+ handles your data. The core principle is simple: all data stays on your device.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>Paperless+ does not collect, transmit, or share any personal or sensitive user data. Specifically, the app does not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Collect personal information</li>
    <li>Upload documents or metadata to any cloud or remote server</li>
    <li>Track user behavior or analytics</li>
    <li>Use advertising identifiers or third-party SDKs</li>
    <li>Access location data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Local Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All data is stored locally using the IndexedDB browser database. This includes document titles, descriptions, categories, expiration dates, and photos (stored as Base64 strings). No data ever leaves your device.</p>

  <h2>4. Camera Access</h2>
  <p>The app may request camera access only for capturing document images. Captured photos are stored locally and are never uploaded or transmitted. Camera access is optional and used solely for document capture within the app.</p>

  <h2>5. Notifications</h2>
  <p>Paperless+ uses local browser notifications to remind users about expiring or important documents. These notifications are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Generated locally on your device</li>
    <li>Not reliant on external servers or services</li>
    <li>Fully manageable through your device or browser settings</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. No Account Required</h2>
  <p>Paperless+ does not require account registration, login, or authentication of any kind. Users are not asked to provide any identifying information such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Portability</h2>
  <p>The app includes import/export functionality to allow users to back up or move their data between devices. This is a manual process. Exported files are stored locally and remain under the user’s full control.</p>

  <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Paperless+ is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. The app does not collect data from anyone, regardless of age, and complies with regulations like COPPA and GDPR-K by design.</p>

  <h2>9. No Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Paperless+ does not integrate any third-party services, APIs, analytics tools, or advertising platforms. All functionality is self-contained and designed for offline use.</p>

  <h2>10. User Consent</h2>
  <p>By using Paperless+, you consent to this privacy-first approach. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, you should discontinue use of the application.</p>

  <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect functional or legal changes. Any updates will be posted on this page. Continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 11, 2025</p>

  <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy or Paperless+ in general, please contact:</p>
